# 📺 iPixelColor Plex Now‑Playing Display

A Python script that connects your **Plex Media Server** to an **iPixel Color LED sign** over BLE, displaying real‑time “Now Playing” information — or a customizable idle mode with optional built‑in clock display.

This project is designed for reliability and hands‑off operation. Once configured, it runs continuously and automatically reconnects to your LED sign if the bluetooth connection drops.

* actually much smoother than this, but made this gif and its a little jumpy.

* idle screen when nothing is playing can be the built in clock, blank, or some text you want like theater or DJ name.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.10+  
- `plexapi` (auto‑installed if missing)  
- `pypixelcolor` (auto‑installed if missing)  
- A BLE‑capable (Bluetooth Low Energy) system  
- An iPixel Color LED sign  

The script installs missing modules automatically.
Works on a Raspberry pi 5B.

---

## 🚀 Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/pir8radio/Plex-iPixelColor-Now-Playing
cd Plex-iPixelColor-Now-Playing
```

Run the script:

```
python iPixelColor-Plex.py
```

On first launch, you will be prompted for:

- Plex server IP  
- Plex server port  
- Plex token  

Then the script will scan for BLE LED signs and let you select one.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings are stored in:

```
pixelcolor_config.json
```

Example:

```
{
    "plex_url": "http://127.0.0.1:32400",
    "plex_token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
    "print_playing": false,
    "target_device": "chrome",
    "poll_interval": 5,
    "use_clock": false,
    "idle_text": " ",
    "text_color": "ff0000",
    "animation_type": 1,
    "animation_speed": 80,
    "ble_address": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
    "brightness": 80
}
```

### Key Options

| Setting | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `plex_url` | Your Plex server URL |
| `plex_token` | Plex authentication token |
| `print_playing` | 'true' Helps find correct plex player |
| `target_device` | Which Plex player to monitor |
| `use_clock` | `true` = built‑in LED clock when idle |
| `idle_text` | Text to show when nothing is playing |
| `brightness` | LED brightness (0–100) |
| `animation_type` | Text animation style |
| `animation_speed` | Scroll speed |

# 🔑 How to Get Your Plex Token

Your Plex token is required for the script to authenticate with your Plex Media Server.  
Here are the easiest ways to retrieve it.

---

## Method 1 — Quick URL Trick (Fastest)

1. Open this URL in your browser, replacing `YOUR_PLEX_IP` and `PORT`:

```
http://YOUR_PLEX_IP:PORT/?X-Plex-Token=1
```

Example:

```
http://10.0.1.18:32400/?X-Plex-Token=1
```

2. Your browser will show an XML page.  
3. Look for:

```
X-Plex-Token="YOURTOKENHERE"
```

---

## Method 2 — Plex Web Inspector (Most Reliable)

1. Open Plex Web:

```
http://YOUR_PLEX_IP:32400/web
```

2. Sign in.  
3. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools.  
4. Go to the **Network** tab.  
5. Click around inside Plex.  
6. Look for any request containing:

```
X-Plex-Token=
```

The long string after that is your token.

---

## Method 3 — Plex Settings (Sometimes Hidden)

1. Open Plex Web.  
2. Go to **Settings → Network**.  
3. Scroll to the bottom.  
4. Look for:

```
Plex Token
```

Click **Show** to reveal it.

---

## ⚠️ Keep Your Token Private

Your Plex token grants full access to your server.  
Do **not** share it publicly or commit it to GitHub.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Connects to Plex and monitors your chosen device  
2. Connects to your iPixel LED sign via BLE  
3. When media starts playing:
   - Sends the title to the LED sign  
4. When playback stops:
   - Shows idle text **or** built‑in clock  
5. If BLE disconnects:
   - Reconnects  
   - Restores brightness  
   - Refreshes display  

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### LED sign not found

Run:

```
pypixelcolor --scan
```

Ensure Bluetooth is enabled.

### Plex not detected

Verify:
- Plex IP is correct  
- Port is correct  
- Token is valid  
- Device name matches your Plex player  

### Script exits immediately

Run from a terminal to view error output.
